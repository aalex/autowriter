** this is just a dummy file to make the lousy        **
** arduino pseudo-ide happy.                          **
**                                                    **
** for some reason they decided to use .pde as the    **
** extension for source files, instead of what they   **
** are: .c                                            **
** funny enough, they still process .c files if there **
** are yn in the directory.                           **
**                                                    **
** so, we need that quirky fix just for them.         **
**                                                    **
** you find the real code in the .c files, of course  **
** dont forget to uncomment #USE_ARDUINO in HPGL.h    **
** if you really want to use their gui.               **
**                                                    **
